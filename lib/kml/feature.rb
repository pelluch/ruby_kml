    # A string value representing an unstructured address written as a standard street, city, state address, and/or as 
    # a postal code. You can use the +address+ attribute to specify the location of a point instead of using latitude and 
    # longitude coordinates. (However, if a Point is provided, it takes precedence over the +address+.) To find out 
    # which locales are supported for this tag in Google Earth, go to the 
    # <a href="http://maps.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=16634">Google Maps Help</a>.
    attr_accessor :address

    # A structured address, formatted as xAL, or eXtensible Address Language, an international standard for address 
    # formatting. AddressDetails is used by KML for geocoding in Google Maps only. For details, see the Google Maps 
    # API documentation. Currently, Google Earth does not use this attribute; use +address+ instead.
    attr_accessor :address_details

    # A string value representing a telephone number. This element is used by Google Maps Mobile only. The industry 
    # standard for Java-enabled cellular phones is RFC2806. For more information, see 
    # <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2806.txt">http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2806.txt</a>.

    # User-supplied text that appears in the description balloon when the user clicks on either the feature name 
    # in the Places panel or the Placemark icon in the 3D viewer. This text also appears beneath the feature name 
    # in the Places panel if no Snippet is specified for the feature.
    # 
    # Description supports plain text as well as a subset of HTML formatting elements, including tables. It does 
    # not support other web-based technology, such as dynamic page markup (PHP, JSP, ASP), scripting languages 
    # (VBScript, Javascript), nor application languages (Java, Python).
    # 
    # If your description contains no HTML markup, Google Earth attempts to format it, replacing newlines with 
    # &lt;br&gt; and wrapping URLs with anchor tags. A valid URL string for the World Wide Web is automatically 
    # converted to a hyperlink to that URL (e.g., http://www.google.com). Consequently, you do not need to surround 
    # a URL with the &lt;a href="http://.."&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tags in order to achieve a simple link.

    # URI (a URI equals [URL]#ID) of a Style or StyleMap defined in a Document. If the style is in the same file, 
    # use a # reference. If the style is defined in an external file, use a full URL along with # referencing. Examples:
    #
    #   +style_url='#myIconStyleID'

    attr_accessor :style_url

    # One or more Styles and StyleMaps can be defined to customize the appearance of any element derived from Feature 
    # or of the Geometry in a Placemark. (See BalloonStyle, ListStyle, StyleSelector, and the styles derived from 
    # ColorStyle.) A style defined within a Feature is called an "inline style" and applies only to the Feature that 
    # contains it. A style defined as the child of a Document is called a "shared style." A shared style must have an id 
    # defined for it. This id is referenced by one or more Features within the <Document>. In cases where a style element 
    # is defined both in a shared style and in an inline style for a Feature—that is, a Folder, GroundOverlay, 
    # NetworkLink, Placemark, or ScreenOverlay—the value for the Feature's inline style takes precedence over the value 
    # for the shared style.
