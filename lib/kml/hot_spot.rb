  # Specifies the position within the Icon that is "anchored" to the <Point> specified in the Placemark. 
  # The x and y values can be specified in three different ways: as pixels ("pixels"), as fractions of 
  # the icon ("fraction"), or as inset pixels ("insetPixels"), which is an offset in pixels from the upper 
  # right corner of the icon. The x and y positions can be specified in different waysâ€”for example, x can 
  # be in pixels and y can be a fraction. The origin of the coordinate system is in the lower left corner 
  # of the icon.
  # 
  # * x - Either the number of pixels, a fractional component of the icon, or a pixel inset indicating the 
  #   x component of a point on the icon.
  # * y - Either the number of pixels, a fractional component of the icon, or a pixel inset indicating the 
  #   y component of a point on the icon.
  # * xunits - Units in which the x value is specified. Default="fraction". A value of "fraction" indicates 
  #   the x value is a fraction of the icon. A value of "pixels" indicates the x value in pixels. A value of 
  #   "insetPixels" indicates the indent from the right edge of the icon.
  # * yunits - Units in which the y value is specified. Default="fraction". A value of "fraction" indicates 
  #   the y value is a fraction of the icon. A value of "pixels" indicates the y value in pixels. A value of 
  #   "insetPixels" indicates the indent from the top edge of the icon.
